  This project is a ERP system, with a material design concept. I've been proudly developing it with React Js, thinking in the best UX as possible. Using some libs to make it easyer to develop, such as styled componens and number input, it's in the layout stablishment stage.

  I'm making its components to organize and write with the best practices, to make it readable and clean. The React universe makes me amazed everyday.
